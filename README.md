This the respository that contains the code used for bulk RNAseq, scRNAseq, and microbiome analysis.

# Bulk RNAseq
bulkDESeq.R: This R notebook can be used to reproduce differential gene expression and heatmap construction.

# scRNAseq 
Secondary_Bacterial_Ingest_QC_Clustering.ipynb: This jupyter notebook can be used to reproduce cell clustering for single cell RNAseq. 

# Microbiota
COMET_Microbiome_Final.ipynb: This jupyter notebook can be used to calculate Alpha and Beta Diversity with Bacteria and Fungi +/- protozoa.
