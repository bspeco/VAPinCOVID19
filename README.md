# VAPinCOVID19
This the respository that contains the code used for bulk RNAseq, scRNAseq, and microbiome analysis.

# Bulk RNAseq
bulkDESeq.R: This R notebook can be used to reproduce differential gene expression and heatmap construction.

# scRNAseq 
PreprocessTrachAspirate_GITHUBnotations.ipynb: Data was processed and combined into adata ojbect
scVI_GITHUBnotations.ipynb: scVI computation
Clustering_lowclusterforDE_GITHUBannotations.ipynb: clustering (low resolution for entire mono/mac group - saved to take to R)
Clustering_highres_GITHUBannotations.ipynb: higher resolution clustering, cell numbers, UMAPs
R markdowns for pathway, volcano, and heatmaps: Rmarkdown_4GitHub.Rmd

# Microbiota
COMET_Microbiome_Final.ipynb: This jupyter notebook can be used to calculate Alpha and Beta Diversity with Bacteria and Fungi.
